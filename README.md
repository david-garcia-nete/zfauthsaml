zfauthsaml
==========

## Goal ##
The goal of this project is to provide a Zend\Authentication adapter that wraps simpleSAMLphp to provide SAML authentication.
At this point I'm not sure if simpleSAMLphp can be used strictly as a library or if it requires you to use its defined configuration files and such. Initially I'm working on the adapter to use an existing configured instance of simpleSAMLphp and then hope to refactor to wrap the library itself to be fully inclusive and support standard ZF application configuration strategies.

## Needs ##
If you have expertise with simpleSAMLphp I would love some help, connect with me through github.
